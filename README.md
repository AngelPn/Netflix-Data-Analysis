# About
[Assignment](https://github.com/AngelPn/Netflix-Data-Analysis/blob/main/1st-Assignment-2021.pdf) in the course "Data Mining" at DIT - UoA. The notebook deals with data from a well-known content platform and production company, Netflix. The following questions are answered:
1. Which type is superior, the movies or the series?
2. Has Netflix invested more in movies or series in recent years?
3. Which country has the most content?
4. What kind of content (genre) does each country have?
5. Plot graphs showing the actors with the most movies in each country. Do the same for the series.
6. Plot a graph that gathers the number of movies depending on the suggested age. Do the same for the series.
7. If a producer wanted to have a high audience, he thinks it would be better to make his film at a time when it does not exist much competition. Plot a graph with the content added per month to help him choose the right time period.
8. Prepare a chart that summarizes the kind of content.
9. Plot graphs showing the directors in each country.
10. Plot graphs showing movies analog to number of seasons.
11. Which are the highest rated movies?

The dataset is loaded from the files into [data](https://github.com/AngelPn/Netflix-Data-Analysis/tree/main/data) directory.

## Recomendation System
Recommendations are based on attributes of the item. Content-based recommender systems work well when descriptive data on the content is provided beforehand. “Similarity” is measured against product attributes: Jaccard similarity and Cosine similarity.
